And i will also share what was i learned in here as my documentation, so for just in case if i forget it, and i just open this blog to see it again.

I hope this blog also can help you to grow and learn something new for your career as software engineer and i will write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from Henry Ford
